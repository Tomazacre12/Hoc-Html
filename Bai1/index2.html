          <p class="bold">What is "Touhou?"</p>
          <p class="text">Touhou is an extremely popular series of vertical shooting games of the "bullet hell" or "curtain fire" variety, also known as "danmaku," where enemies not only shoot directly at you, but also fire patterned bullets to weave through.</p>
          <p class="text">Created by Zun, the Touhou game series entails an ongoing story of events set in the fictional realm of Gensokyo, revolving mostly -though not entirely - around incidents regarding the main character, Reimu Hakurei, and the Hakurei Shrine.</p>
          <p class="text">The series is best-known for its beautiful bullet patterns, seamless story development, and intriguing character interactions; like typical RPGs, character personalities are well-developed, considering the game type, and the dialogue is infused with both drama and humor, making Touhou fun not only in the combat aspect, but also interesting to watch unfold.</p>
          <p class="bold">Aren't these in Japanese?</p>
          <p class="text">Originally, yes.  However, we save you some trouble by pre-applying English patches when they are available, especially when it comes to the official games.
            (They also come ready-to-play; no need to use potentially confusing methods to use an .iso file to install them.)</p>
          <p class="bold">Getting Started</p> 
          <p class="text">The stories may differ, but how you actually begin playing never does.  Every shooting game in the series always asks the same three things before you get started:</p>
          <p class="bold2">1) Difficulty Selection</p>
          <p class="text">The first thing you're asked to do after hitting "Start Game" is to select your difficulty level (seeing as not everybody is able to walk in the rain without getting wet when they first start).
            All Touhou games come with four selectable levels of difficulty to choose from:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="easy">Easy</li>
              <li class="normal">Normal</li>
              <li class="hard">Hard</li>
              <li class="lunatic">Lunatic</li>
            </ul>
